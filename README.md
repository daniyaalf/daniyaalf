I'm an MScAC student at the University of Toronto in the Quantum Computing concentration, and I recently completed my HBSc at UofT as a Physics & Computer Science double major and Mathematics minor (conferred June 2025). I'm currently taking courses on Quantum Algorithms, Quantum Optics, and Ethical Aspects of AI. 

I am performing research in quantum simulation and STEM education with a focus on computer science. My research interests also include the ethical concerns surrounding the increasing presence of AI in society.

My research in quantum simulation is conducted with a postdoctoral researcher in The Matter Lab. My tasks include using OpenFermion to execute our algorithms on molecular Hamiltonians and quantify the error using spectral or diamond norm. I've also become familiar with the theory side of the project, learning techniques such as oblivious amplitude amplification, linear combinations of unitaries, and novel techniques for linearly combining quantum channels. 

My research in STEM education is conducted with Professors Alice Gao and Jonathan Calver in the Computer Science Department at UofT. We are writing a literature review of interventions for academic procrastination in computer science post-secondary students, which will be submitted to ITiCSE '26.

Another interest of mine is video game design. I taught myself how to use Godot Game Engine at a beginner level in the Summer of 2023; see the repository "Snow" for a project I worked on.
