I'm a fourth-year undergraduate at the University of Toronto studying Physics, Computer Science, and Mathematics. I graduate in June 2025.
I am currently performing research in quantum simulation for electronic structure problems and procrastination in postsecondary STEM students.

I'm also interested in Video Game Design as a hobby, and have some experience using Godot Game Engine.
