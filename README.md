I'm a third year at UoFT studying Physics, Computer Science, and Mathematics.
I wanna go into Quantum Computing but I think Video Game Design is pretty awesome too.
I'm also decent at Spelunky 2: https://mossranking.com/user.php?id_user=7404&t=3
My favourite video games are Spelunky HD & 2, Undertale, Elden Ring & every other Fromsoft game, Minecraft, Final Fantasy 9, Omori, Dragonfable and so on
